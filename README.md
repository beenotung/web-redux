# web-redux-template

Store state and run reducer on the server, push sub-state to client in realtime.

## Features

- Centralized state management on the server
  - single source of truth
  - enforce integrity of update logics
  - enforce access control
- Auto push realtime updates to multiple clients
- Align with [event sourcing architecture and CQRS pattern](https://cqrs-documents.surge.sh)

## Data Flow

1. server run reducer to load initial state

2. client subscribe to sub-state generated by selector

3. server pass initial sub-state to client

4. client dispatch action to server

5. server run reducer to build new state from current state and current action

6. server check attached selectors and push updates to client (in any browser)

## Todo

- Allow passing arguments to selector

---

- Enhance web socket setting to auto reconnect when network is recovered

---

- Enhance selector sub-state update detection for object and array / allow to combine multiple selector into object or array

This is importance, because we cannot use multiple fine-grain useSelectors in the same component like react-redux due to suspense API pattern adopted in this implementation

---

- Setup authentication with JWT
